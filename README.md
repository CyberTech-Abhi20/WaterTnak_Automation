# WaterTnak_Automation
 By using Arduino UNO R3 and SR-04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor.
<h1> Componants we need </h1> 
<br> • Arduino UNO R3 </br>
<br> • SR-04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor   (5V) operating voltage </br>
<br> • Relay module (5V) operating voltage  </br>
<br>   * depending your requirment buy single channal Board </br>
<br> • Jumper wires ( male to male) </br>
<br> • Buzzer for Ring </br>
<br> • LED for Indication Water_Tank full or Empty</br>
<br> • Data cable (for uploading sketch and giving power supply ) </br>
<h1>Why Arduino Boards? </h1> 
<p> Arduino board has been used for making different engineering projects and different applications. The Arduino software is very simple to use for beginners, yet flexible adequate for advanced users. It runs Windows, Linux, and Mac. Teachers and students in the schools utilize it to design low-cost scientific instruments to verify the principles of physics and chemistry. There are numerous other microcontroller platforms obtainable for physical computing. The Netmedia’s BX-24, Parallax Basic Stamp, MIT’s Handyboard, Phidget, and many others present related functionality.
Arduino also makes simpler the working process of microcontroller, but it gives some advantages over other systems for teachers, students, and beginners.
